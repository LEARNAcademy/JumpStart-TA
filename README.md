# JumpStart!- Volunteer Repo 
## Welcome Aboard: Thank you for joining us on this voyage!


### In this document you will find the steps needed to be taken to get up to speed on being a volunteer "Teacher's Assistant" for LEARN academy's JumpStart! 

1. First thing you'll need is the [TA Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yR8Y3PKb84WS6AJWSodXAHF1xCDWxLJFp9KSoI4xiJU/edit?usp=sharing). This handbook sets out the goals and expectations for the weekend. It is essential that each member of the JumpStart! volunteer team familiarize themselves with the handbook. 

2. Secondly, you'll need to double check and confirm the [TA Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WWj9p8FtKYbGCFUBF5QVI6-5QGFtyfSFK77d4cWpsl4/edit?usp=sharing)
   
   __Confirm your time slot on slack by replying in thread with your day and time slot!__

3. Double check you are a member of the revelant "Student-jumpstart" slack channel and respond with a "hello" post to said relevant student channel.  
    ie. JumpStart! August => #jumpstart-students-august  
    eg: "Hey all, Looking forward to this weekend!"

4. Depending on your time slot will be the material that will have been covered in JumpStart! up to that point. Please review and keep handy the [Student Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15SDOmmo6bphM7_GfW4iWJdIExJ8FS3zFFfEkGpUWdFk/edit?usp=sharing) -- **Especially the parts you will be responsible for assisting.**

5. The build out for the weekend is available in this repo. Feel free to make PR to this repository if you have any suggestions on material changes. We humbly ask that you also provide teaching guides for any desired updates. 

6. Please confirm you have gone through all the material laid out in this README and the relevant files of this repository by commenting "completed" on the volunteer slack message that linked this repo.
