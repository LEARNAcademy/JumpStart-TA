# Jumpstart Student Teaching Assistant Resources

Welcome Aboard: Thank you for joining us on this voyage!

### Action Items

2. Ensure you are a member of the revelant `student-jumpstart` slack channel. Reach out to the students and say hello!

When you have completed these action items respond to the post in the Jumpstart Volunteers channel with an emoji.
