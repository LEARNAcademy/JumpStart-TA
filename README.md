# JumpStart!- Volunteer Repo 
## Welcome Aboard: Thank you for joining us on this voyage!


### In this document you will find the steps needed to be taken to get up to speed on being a volunteer "Teacher's Assistant" for LEARN academy's JumpStart! 

# Action Items

### Read through the [TA Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yR8Y3PKb84WS6AJWSodXAHF1xCDWxLJFp9KSoI4xiJU/edit?usp=sharing). This handbook sets out the goals and expectations for the weekend. It is essential that each member of the JumpStart! volunteer team be familiar  with the handbook.  
    Please give this thread a "green check mark" emoji when you have accomplished this. 

### Double check you are a member of the revelant "Student-jumpstart" slack channel and respond with a "hello" post to said relevant student channel.  
    ie. JumpStart! August => #jumpstart-students-august  
    eg: "Hey all, Looking forward to this weekend!"
